- Performance metrics parsing and analysis
- Threshold validation against requirements
- JSON and HTML report generation
- Comprehensive performance analysis

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### 2. Performance Requirements Validator (`scripts/validate-performance-requirements.js`)

**Features**:
- Validates all performance requirements from specification
- Maps test results to specific requirements (e.g., Requirement 2.5)
- Provides optimization recommendations for failed requirements
- Generates validation reports with pass/fail status
- Tracks performance against defined thresholds

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run validate:performance
```
