- Deleted database connection utilities
- Cleaned up MongoDB driver dependencies
- Removed database seeding and migration scripts

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env` files to remove database variables
- Cleaned up backend server configuration
- Preserved AI service API keys and React Native configs

### ✅ Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md technology stack
- Revised ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
- Cleaned up TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Removed backend references from setup guides

### ✅ Development Infrastructure
- Removed Docker Compose database services
- Cleaned up package.json scripts
- Removed database-related test files
- Eliminated unused Python services

### ✅ Final Optimization
- Removed unused product data files
- Cleaned up Python virtual environments
- Optimized project structure

## Current Architecture

**SMARTIES** is now a streamlined React Native mobile application with:

- **React Native Frontend**: Primary user interface
- **AsyncStorage**: Local data persistence
- **Direct API Integration**: Open Food Facts, AI services
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Reduced from 15+ to 8 core dependencies

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated 3-tier architecture
2. **Faster Development**: Direct API integration
3. **Lower Maintenance**: No database infrastructure
4. **Improved Performance**: Fewer network hops
5. **Simplified Deployment**: Single React Native app

## Files Modified/Removed

### Removed Files
- `backend-server.js`
- `backend-package.json`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- MongoDB setup scripts (6 files)
- Database test files (8 files)
- Python embedding services (4 files)
- Product data files (8 JSON files)

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts cleanup
- `.env*` files - Environment variable cleanup
- `README.md` - Architecture documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - Updated design
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Removed database sections

## Next Steps

1. **React Native Development**: Focus on mobile app features
2. **API Integration**: Implement Open Food Facts integration
3. **AI Services**: Configure OpenAI/Anthropic services
4. **Testing**: Update test suites for simplified architecture
5. **Deployment**: Prepare for mobile app deployment
