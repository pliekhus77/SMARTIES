# iOS Development on Windows

## Limitations
iOS development on Windows has significant limitations due to Apple's licensing restrictions:

- **No Xcode**: Xcode only runs on macOS
- **No iOS Simulator**: iOS Simulator requires macOS
- **No direct iOS device testing**: Requires Xcode for provisioning

## Available Options for Windows Users

### 1. Cloud-Based Solutions
- **Expo Go App**: Test React Native apps on physical iOS devices
- **Expo Development Build**: Custom development builds for testing
- **Cloud CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions with macOS runners for iOS builds

### 2. Virtual Machine Solutions (Not Recommended)
- Running macOS in a VM violates Apple's license agreement
- Performance issues and instability
- Not suitable for professional development

### 3. Remote Mac Solutions
- **MacStadium**: Cloud-based Mac rental
- **AWS EC2 Mac instances**: Dedicated Mac hardware in the cloud
- **MacinCloud**: Virtual Mac desktop service

## Recommended Approach for SMARTIES Hackathon

### For Development
1. **Use Expo Go** for iOS testing on physical devices
2. **Focus on Android** for primary development and testing
3. **Use Expo EAS Build** for creating iOS builds in the cloud

### Setup Steps
1. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
2. Create Expo account at https://expo.dev
3. Install Expo Go app on iOS device from App Store
4. Use QR code scanning to test apps on iOS device

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# Scan QR code with Expo Go app on iOS device
# App will load and update in real-time
```

## Alternative: React Native CLI with Cloud Builds

If using React Native CLI instead of Expo:

1. **Development**: Focus on Android emulator/device
2. **iOS Builds**: Use GitHub Actions with macOS runners
3. **Testing**: Use TestFlight for iOS app distribution

## GitHub Actions iOS Build Example

```yaml
name: iOS Build
on: [push]
jobs:
  ios-build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: cd ios && pod install
      - run: npx react-native build-ios
```

## Conclusion

For the SMARTIES hackathon:
- **Primary development**: Android (full toolchain available)
- **iOS testing**: Expo Go app on physical devices
- **iOS builds**: Cloud-based solutions (Expo EAS or GitHub Actions)

This approach allows Windows developers to create cross-platform React Native apps while working within the constraints of the platform.
