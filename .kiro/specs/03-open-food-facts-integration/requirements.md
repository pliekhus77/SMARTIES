# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the Open Food Facts integration phase (steps 3.1 - 3.5) of the SMARTIES hackathon project. The goal is to establish automated product data ingestion from the Open Food Facts API to populate the database with real-world product information, enabling comprehensive testing and demonstration of the dietary compliance features with actual commercial products.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to set up an Open Food Facts API client so that the application can automatically retrieve product information from the world's largest open food database for barcode lookups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API client is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to the Open Food Facts REST API endpoints
2. WHEN authentication is handled THEN the system SHALL include proper User-Agent headers and rate limiting compliance
3. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle API timeouts, rate limits, and invalid responses
4. WHEN data formats are managed THEN the system SHALL parse JSON responses and handle multiple language variants
5. WHEN the client is tested THEN the system SHALL successfully retrieve product data for known UPC codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to import 500-1000 popular products automatically so that the application has a substantial product database for realistic testing and demonstration scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product selection is implemented THEN the system SHALL prioritize popular US consumer products with complete ingredient data
2. WHEN batch import is executed THEN the system SHALL process 500-1000 products within the hackathon time constraints
3. WHEN data quality is ensured THEN the system SHALL filter products with missing or incomplete ingredient information
4. WHEN import progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL provide logging and status updates during the import process
5. WHEN duplicate handling is managed THEN the system SHALL avoid importing products that already exist in the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an allergen detection specialist, I want to parse ingredient lists for allergen detection so that the system can automatically identify potential allergens in imported products without manual review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingredient parsing is implemented THEN the system SHALL extract and normalize ingredient lists from Open Food Facts data
2. WHEN allergen identification occurs THEN the system SHALL detect FDA Top 9 allergens within ingredient text using pattern matching
3. WHEN ingredient normalization is applied THEN the system SHALL handle variations in ingredient naming and formatting
4. WHEN allergen extraction is validated THEN the system SHALL correctly identify allergens in complex ingredient lists with additives
5. WHEN parsing accuracy is verified THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% accuracy in allergen detection for test products

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance engineer, I want to create basic allergen mapping rules so that the system can consistently identify allergens across different product formats and ingredient naming conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping rules are defined THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive patterns for each FDA Top 9 allergen
2. WHEN ingredient variations are handled THEN the system SHALL recognize common alternative names (e.g., "whey" for milk, "albumin" for eggs)
3. WHEN compound ingredients are processed THEN the system SHALL identify allergens within parenthetical ingredient lists
4. WHEN allergen warnings are parsed THEN the system SHALL extract "contains" and "may contain" statements from product labels
5. WHEN rule validation is completed THEN the system SHALL test mapping rules against known products with verified allergen content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to validate data quality and fix issues so that the imported product database maintains high accuracy and reliability for safety-critical allergen detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify completeness of required fields (UPC, name, ingredients)
2. WHEN quality metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL measure and report data completeness and accuracy percentages
3. WHEN data cleaning is applied THEN the system SHALL standardize product names, remove duplicates, and fix formatting issues
4. WHEN allergen validation occurs THEN the system SHALL cross-reference detected allergens with official product labeling when available
5. WHEN quality issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL document and fix critical data problems that could affect safety determinations
