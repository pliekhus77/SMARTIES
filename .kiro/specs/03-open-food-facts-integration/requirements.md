# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the UPC Product Search and Allergen Detection feature for the SMARTIES mobile application. The goal is to enable users to scan product barcodes, retrieve product information from Open Food Facts API, perform real-time allergen analysis against their dietary profile, and display appropriate result screens based on the severity of detected violations (Severe Allergy, Mild Warning, or All Clear).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user scanning products on the ScanScreen, I want the system to automatically search for product information when a UPC is detected so that I can immediately see dietary compliance results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ScanScreen successfully captures a UPC barcode THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a product search using the SMARTIES API
2. WHEN the API returns product data THEN the system SHALL extract product name, ingredients, allergen information, and nutritional data
3. WHEN the product is not found in the SMARTIES database THEN the system SHALL display a "Product Not Found" message with manual entry option
4. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and allow retry from the scan screen
5. WHEN the product lookup succeeds THEN the system SHALL cache the product data locally and proceed to allergen analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with dietary restrictions, I want the system to automatically analyze scanned products against my profile restrictions so that I can immediately see if the product is safe for me to consume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze ingredients against the user's current dietary restrictions profile
2. WHEN allergen analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL check ingredient lists, "contains" statements, and "may contain" warnings
3. WHEN a dietary violation is detected THEN the system SHALL determine the severity level based on the user's restriction settings (severe, mild, lifestyle)
4. WHEN multiple violations are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most severe restriction for display
5. WHEN allergen analysis completes THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate to the appropriate result screen based on violation severity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who scans a product with severe allergen violations, I want to see a prominent warning screen immediately after scanning so that I can understand the danger and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a severe allergen violation is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate from ScanScreen to the "Severe Allergy Detected" result screen
2. WHEN the severe warning screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a red gradient background with prominent warning icon and pulsing animation
3. WHEN product details are presented THEN the system SHALL display product name, UPC, detected allergen, and specific risk information (e.g., "Risk: Anaphylactic")
4. WHEN action buttons are provided THEN the system SHALL offer "Save to History" and "Report Issue" options
5. WHEN the user interacts with the screen THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback and audio alerts for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who scans a product with mild dietary violations, I want to see a warning screen immediately after scanning so that I can make an informed decision about consuming the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mild dietary violation is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate from ScanScreen to the "Mild Warning" result screen
2. WHEN the mild warning screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a yellow/orange gradient background with caution icon (no aggressive animations)
3. WHEN product information is presented THEN the system SHALL display product name, UPC, and detected dietary concern (e.g., "Contains dairy")
4. WHEN action options are provided THEN the system SHALL offer "Save to History" and "Report Issue" buttons
5. WHEN the bottom navigation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the standard app navigation tabs for easy navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who scans a safe product, I want to see a clear confirmation screen immediately after scanning so that I know the product is safe for my dietary restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no dietary violations are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate from ScanScreen to the "All Clear" result screen
2. WHEN the safe confirmation screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a green gradient background with checkmark icon and positive visual feedback
3. WHEN product details are presented THEN the system SHALL display product name, UPC, and "No issues detected" message
4. WHEN the completion action is provided THEN the system SHALL offer a "Done" button to return to the ScanScreen for additional scanning
5. WHEN the bottom navigation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the standard app navigation tabs for easy navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my scan results to be saved to history automatically so that I can review my previous scans and track my dietary compliance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product scan is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically save the result to scan history
2. WHEN scan data is stored THEN the system SHALL include product details, allergen analysis results, timestamp, and violation severity
3. WHEN the user selects "Save to History" THEN the system SHALL confirm the save action with visual feedback
4. WHEN scan history is accessed THEN the system SHALL display results grouped by date with appropriate severity indicators
5. WHEN offline scanning occurs THEN the system SHALL queue scan results for sync when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who finds incorrect product information, I want to report issues so that the product database can be improved for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Report Issue" THEN the system SHALL open an issue reporting form
2. WHEN issue details are collected THEN the system SHALL capture product UPC, detected allergens, user's concern, and optional comments
3. WHEN the report is submitted THEN the system SHALL send the issue to the backend for review
4. WHEN the report is successful THEN the system SHALL show confirmation and return to the previous screen
5. WHEN reporting fails THEN the system SHALL save the report locally and retry when connectivity is restored
