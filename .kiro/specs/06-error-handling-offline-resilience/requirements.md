# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers comprehensive error handling and offline resilience for the SMARTIES mobile application. The goal is to provide users with a seamless experience even when network connectivity is poor, intermittent, or completely unavailable. This includes handling API failures, network timeouts, app update failures, and providing meaningful feedback with recovery options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user experiencing network connectivity issues, I want the app to handle connection failures gracefully so that I can continue using core features even when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects network connectivity loss THEN the system SHALL display a non-intrusive connectivity status indicator
2. WHEN API requests fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s intervals)
3. WHEN maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached data if available
4. WHEN no cached data exists THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with manual retry option
5. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync pending operations and update the connectivity indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user encountering app update failures, I want to receive clear information about the issue and options to resolve it so that I can continue using the app without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN app update download fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue (network, storage, server)
2. WHEN update failure occurs THEN the system SHALL provide actionable options: "Retry Now", "Try Later", or "Skip This Update"
3. WHEN the user chooses "Retry Now" THEN the system SHALL attempt the update again with progress indication
4. WHEN the user chooses "Try Later" THEN the system SHALL schedule automatic retry in 1 hour and allow normal app usage
5. WHEN the user chooses "Skip This Update" THEN the system SHALL suppress update prompts for 24 hours and continue with current version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user scanning products while offline, I want to access previously scanned products and receive basic safety information so that I can make informed decisions without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scans a previously cached product while offline THEN the system SHALL display the cached product information and analysis results
2. WHEN the user scans an unknown product while offline THEN the system SHALL display "Offline - Product Unknown" with option to save for later lookup
3. WHEN offline scanning occurs THEN the system SHALL queue the scan for processing when connectivity returns
4. WHEN cached allergen analysis is available THEN the system SHALL display the previous analysis with "Offline Data" indicator
5. WHEN no cached data exists THEN the system SHALL provide basic allergen detection based on user-entered ingredients

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing API errors, I want to understand what went wrong and have clear options to resolve the issue so that I can continue using the app effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API returns server error (5xx) THEN the system SHALL display "Service temporarily unavailable" with automatic retry in 30 seconds
2. WHEN API returns client error (4xx) THEN the system SHALL display specific error message based on error code with appropriate action
3. WHEN API request times out THEN the system SHALL display "Request timed out" with manual retry option
4. WHEN API returns malformed data THEN the system SHALL log the error and display "Data processing error" with fallback to cached data
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL attempt token refresh and retry, or prompt for re-authentication if refresh fails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with limited storage space, I want the app to manage cached data efficiently so that it doesn't consume excessive device storage while maintaining offline functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cached data exceeds 50MB THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up oldest entries using LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy
2. WHEN storage space is critically low THEN the system SHALL prompt user to clear cache with size information and impact explanation
3. WHEN cache cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve user's dietary profile and recent scan history (last 30 days)
4. WHEN user manually clears cache THEN the system SHALL show confirmation dialog with storage space to be freed
5. WHEN cache is cleared THEN the system SHALL maintain essential data (user profile, app settings) and show confirmation of space freed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user experiencing app crashes or unexpected errors, I want the app to recover gracefully and preserve my data so that I don't lose my progress or settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app crashes during product scanning THEN the system SHALL restore to ScanScreen on restart with user profile intact
2. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details and display generic "Something went wrong" message with restart option
3. WHEN error recovery is triggered THEN the system SHALL preserve user's dietary profile, scan history, and app settings
4. WHEN critical errors persist THEN the system SHALL offer "Reset App Data" option as last resort with clear warning about data loss
5. WHEN app restarts after crash THEN the system SHALL perform integrity check on stored data and repair if necessary

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user in areas with poor connectivity, I want the app to adapt its behavior to work efficiently with slow or intermittent network connections so that I can still use core features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN slow network is detected (>5s response time) THEN the system SHALL switch to low-bandwidth mode with reduced image loading
2. WHEN intermittent connectivity is detected THEN the system SHALL increase request timeout values and retry intervals
3. WHEN network quality improves THEN the system SHALL automatically switch back to normal mode and sync pending operations
4. WHEN in low-bandwidth mode THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential API calls (product lookup) over non-essential ones (analytics)
5. WHEN network adaptation occurs THEN the system SHALL display network status indicator to inform user of current mode

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user who needs to report issues or get help, I want to access support features even when offline so that I can document problems and get assistance when connectivity returns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses help while offline THEN the system SHALL display cached help content and FAQ
2. WHEN the user reports an issue while offline THEN the system SHALL save the report locally with timestamp and sync when online
3. WHEN offline issue reporting occurs THEN the system SHALL capture relevant app state, error logs, and user description
4. WHEN connectivity returns THEN the system SHALL automatically submit queued issue reports and show confirmation
5. WHEN help content is outdated THEN the system SHALL show last update timestamp and attempt refresh when online
