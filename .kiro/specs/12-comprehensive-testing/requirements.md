# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of comprehensive testing for the SMARTIES MAUI mobile application. The goal is to establish a robust testing framework that includes unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, and performance tests to ensure the application's reliability, safety, and quality. Given the critical nature of dietary safety features, this testing implementation will focus on achieving high test coverage, particularly for safety-critical paths, and establishing automated testing pipelines that prevent regressions and ensure consistent quality across all supported platforms.
