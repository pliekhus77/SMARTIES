# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a Profile Selection Screen for the SMARTIES mobile application that allows users to create, select, and manage multiple dietary profiles locally on their device. This screen serves as the entry point for users to establish their identity and dietary restrictions before accessing the main scanning functionality, while maintaining the app's privacy-by-design principles with no backend authentication.
