# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of AI-powered dietary analysis functionality for the SMARTIES MAUI mobile application. The goal is to replace the current mock dietary analysis implementation with a fully functional AI service that integrates with OpenAI or Anthropic APIs to provide intelligent dietary compliance checking. This implementation will analyze product ingredients against user dietary restrictions and provide detailed, contextual safety assessments with appropriate severity levels and actionable recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with dietary restrictions, I want the system to intelligently analyze product ingredients against my profile so that I receive accurate safety assessments for each scanned product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product is successfully retrieved from Open Food Facts THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger AI dietary analysis using the user's current profile
2. WHEN AI analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL send product ingredients, allergens, and user restrictions to the configured AI service (OpenAI or Anthropic)
3. WHEN the AI processes the request THEN the system SHALL receive a structured response with safety assessment, detected violations, and confidence scores
4. WHEN multiple dietary restrictions exist THEN the system SHALL analyze all restrictions and prioritize the most severe violations
5. WHEN AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL return a comprehensive DietaryAnalysis object with all findings and recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with severe allergies, I want the AI to detect direct allergen matches and cross-contamination risks so that I can avoid potentially life-threatening reactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing ingredients for allergies THEN the system SHALL check for direct ingredient matches (e.g., "milk" for dairy allergy)
2. WHEN checking allergen statements THEN the system SHALL parse "Contains:" and "May contain:" warnings for cross-contamination risks
3. WHEN processing ingredients THEN the system SHALL identify hidden allergens in compound ingredients (e.g., "whey" contains dairy)
4. WHEN allergen violations are detected THEN the system SHALL classify them as DirectIngredient, CrossContamination, or ProcessingAid violation types
5. WHEN severe allergens are found THEN the system SHALL set the compliance level to Critical or Violation with appropriate severity markers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with religious dietary restrictions, I want the AI to understand religious compliance rules so that I can maintain my dietary observances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing for Halal compliance THEN the system SHALL check for pork products, alcohol, and non-halal meat sources
2. WHEN analyzing for Kosher compliance THEN the system SHALL check for non-kosher ingredients, meat/dairy combinations, and certification requirements
3. WHEN analyzing for Hindu vegetarian restrictions THEN the system SHALL check for all meat products, fish, eggs, and animal-derived ingredients
4. WHEN religious violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide context about why the ingredient violates the restriction
5. WHEN religious compliance is confirmed THEN the system SHALL note positive compliance and suggest certification verification when available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with medical dietary restrictions, I want the AI to understand medical compliance requirements so that I can manage my health conditions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing for diabetes restrictions THEN the system SHALL check sugar content, carbohydrate levels, and glycemic impact ingredients
2. WHEN analyzing for hypertension restrictions THEN the system SHALL check sodium content, salt levels, and blood pressure affecting ingredients
3. WHEN analyzing for celiac disease THEN the system SHALL check for gluten-containing grains, cross-contamination risks, and hidden gluten sources
4. WHEN medical violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific health impact information and severity assessment
5. WHEN medical compliance analysis completes THEN the system SHALL include quantitative data (sodium mg, sugar g) when available from nutrition facts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with lifestyle preferences, I want the AI to check ingredient compatibility with my chosen lifestyle so that I can maintain my dietary choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing for vegan compliance THEN the system SHALL check for all animal products, dairy, eggs, honey, and animal-derived additives
2. WHEN analyzing for keto compliance THEN the system SHALL check carbohydrate content, sugar levels, and keto-incompatible ingredients
3. WHEN analyzing for organic preferences THEN the system SHALL check for organic certification and flag non-organic ingredients
4. WHEN lifestyle violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide educational information about why ingredients don't align with the lifestyle
5. WHEN lifestyle compliance is confirmed THEN the system SHALL highlight positive aspects and suggest complementary products when appropriate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user receiving dietary analysis results, I want clear, actionable information so that I can make informed decisions about consuming the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide a clear overall safety assessment (Safe, Caution, Warning, Violation, Critical)
2. WHEN violations are detected THEN the system SHALL list specific ingredients causing issues with clear explanations
3. WHEN warnings are appropriate THEN the system SHALL provide contextual information about potential risks and alternatives
4. WHEN the product is safe THEN the system SHALL confirm compliance and highlight positive nutritional aspects
5. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide actionable advice (avoid, consume with caution, safe to consume)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer configuring the AI service, I want secure API key management and error handling so that the AI integration is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL store them securely using MAUI Essentials SecureStorage
2. WHEN making AI API calls THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers and request formatting
3. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
4. WHEN AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to rule-based analysis with appropriate user notification
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information while showing user-friendly messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with limited internet connectivity, I want basic dietary analysis to work offline so that I can still get safety information for previously analyzed products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached analysis results for previously scanned products
2. WHEN offline analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL use rule-based logic for basic allergen detection
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL queue pending analyses and process them with AI enhancement
4. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate limited analysis capability to users
5. WHEN cached results are used THEN the system SHALL show the cache date and suggest re-analysis when online

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want my dietary information to be processed securely so that my personal health data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data to AI services THEN the system SHALL not include personally identifiable information in API requests
