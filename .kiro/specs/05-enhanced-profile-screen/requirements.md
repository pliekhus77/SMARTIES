# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the enhancement of the SMARTIES profile screen to provide an intuitive, visually appealing interface for managing dietary restrictions. The enhanced profile screen will follow the same visual design language as the ScanScreen with a blue gradient background and prominent logo, while introducing interactive slider controls for managing allergen severity levels. This enhancement aims to improve user experience by making dietary restriction management more accessible and visually consistent with the rest of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with dietary restrictions, I want to easily view and manage my allergen sensitivities with clear visual indicators, so that I can quickly adjust my dietary profile settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the profile screen THEN the system SHALL display a blue gradient background matching the ScanScreen design
2. WHEN the profile screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the SMARTIES logo at the top of the screen
3. WHEN the user views their dietary restrictions THEN the system SHALL display each restriction as a card with an icon, name, and severity slider
4. WHEN the user interacts with a severity slider THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with color changes (green for low, yellow for moderate, red for severe)
5. WHEN the user sets a restriction to "Anaphylactic" level THEN the system SHALL display the severity indicator in red with appropriate warning styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple dietary restrictions, I want to use intuitive slider controls to set severity levels for each allergen, so that the app can provide appropriate warnings based on my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views an allergen card THEN the system SHALL display a horizontal slider with three severity levels: Irritation, Severe, and Anaphylactic
2. WHEN the user drags the slider THEN the system SHALL update the severity level in real-time with smooth animations
3. WHEN the user sets a severity level THEN the system SHALL persist the setting immediately to local storage
4. WHEN the severity is set to "Irritation" THEN the system SHALL display a green indicator
5. WHEN the severity is set to "Severe" THEN the system SHALL display a yellow/orange indicator
6. WHEN the severity is set to "Anaphylactic" THEN the system SHALL display a red indicator with bold text
7. WHEN the user releases the slider THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback to confirm the selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with specific allergens like peanuts, I want to add personal notes to my restrictions (such as "Carry EpiPen"), so that I can track important medical information related to my dietary needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views an allergen card THEN the system SHALL display a notes section below the severity slider
2. WHEN the user taps on the notes area THEN the system SHALL open an editable text field
3. WHEN the user enters notes THEN the system SHALL save the notes automatically when the user finishes editing
4. WHEN notes exist for an allergen THEN the system SHALL display them in a readable format with appropriate styling
5. WHEN the notes field is empty THEN the system SHALL display placeholder text like "Add notes..."

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user setting up my dietary profile, I want to easily add new dietary restrictions using a prominent add button, so that I can comprehensively configure my dietary needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the profile screen THEN the system SHALL display a circular "+" button prominently positioned below the existing restrictions
2. WHEN the user taps the add button THEN the system SHALL open a selection interface for available dietary restrictions
3. WHEN the user selects a new restriction THEN the system SHALL add it to their profile with default settings
4. WHEN a new restriction is added THEN the system SHALL animate the new card into view smoothly
5. WHEN the user has no restrictions configured THEN the system SHALL display appropriate onboarding content encouraging them to add restrictions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who wants to remove a dietary restriction, I want to easily delete restrictions I no longer need, so that my profile remains accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views an allergen card THEN the system SHALL display a small "Ã—" button in the top-right corner of each card
2. WHEN the user taps the delete button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the restriction from their profile with a smooth animation
4. WHEN the user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL return to the normal view without changes
5. WHEN a restriction is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the layout to fill the space smoothly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user navigating the app, I want the profile screen to maintain visual consistency with other screens while providing clear navigation options, so that I have a cohesive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the profile screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the title "My Dietary Restrictions" in white text matching the ScanScreen typography
2. WHEN the user views the screen THEN the system SHALL maintain the same blue gradient background (#1E88E5) as the ScanScreen
3. WHEN the user scrolls through multiple restrictions THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance
4. WHEN the screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same SafeAreaView configuration as other screens
5. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide consistent touch feedback and animations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the profile screen to be fully accessible with screen readers and other assistive technologies, so that I can manage my dietary restrictions regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a screen reader user navigates the profile screen THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels for all interactive elements
2. WHEN a user with motor difficulties uses the sliders THEN the system SHALL support alternative input methods
3. WHEN the user has high contrast mode enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain readable contrast ratios
4. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard or switch control THEN the system SHALL provide logical focus order
5. WHEN severity levels change THEN the system SHALL announce the changes to screen readers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user managing my dietary profile, I want my changes to be saved automatically and synchronized across devices, so that my settings are always available when I need them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user modifies any setting THEN the system SHALL save changes to local storage immediately
2. WHEN the device has internet connectivity THEN the system SHALL sync profile changes to the cloud backend
3. WHEN the user opens the app on a different device THEN the system SHALL load their most recent profile settings
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and maintain local changes
5. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent changes with user notification
