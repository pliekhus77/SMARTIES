# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the core architecture setup phase (steps 1.1 - 1.5) of the SMARTIES hackathon project. The goal is to establish the foundational data models, database structure, React Native project configuration, and basic connectivity that will support the scan-based mobile allergen tracking application. This phase builds upon the initial setup and creates the architectural foundation for rapid feature development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to design minimal data models so that the application can efficiently store and retrieve product information, user profiles, and scan results with proper relationships and indexing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Product model is defined THEN the system SHALL include fields for UPC, name, ingredients, allergens, and dietary flags
2. WHEN the User model is created THEN the system SHALL support dietary restrictions, preferences, and profile metadata
3. WHEN the ScanResult model is designed THEN the system SHALL link users to products with timestamp and compliance status
4. WHEN relationships are established THEN the system SHALL support efficient queries across all models
5. WHEN the schema is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and proper field types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to create Atlas collections and basic indexes so that the application can perform fast queries for product lookups, user data retrieval, and scan history searches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collections are created THEN the system SHALL provision products, users, and scan_results collections in MongoDB Atlas
2. WHEN indexes are established THEN the system SHALL create indexes on UPC codes for fast product lookups
3. WHEN user indexes are configured THEN the system SHALL support efficient user profile queries by ID
4. WHEN scan history indexes are set up THEN the system SHALL enable fast retrieval of user scan history
5. WHEN performance is tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate sub-100ms query response times for indexed fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want to set up the React Native project with navigation so that users can move between different screens and the app has a proper structure for feature development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React Native project is initialized THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN navigation is configured THEN the system SHALL include React Navigation with stack and tab navigators
3. WHEN screen structure is created THEN the system SHALL have Scanner, Profile, Results, and Settings screens
4. WHEN routing is implemented THEN the system SHALL support deep linking and proper navigation flow
5. WHEN the project builds successfully THEN the system SHALL run on both iOS and Android simulators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure environment variables and secrets so that the application can securely access external services without exposing sensitive credentials in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL use .env files for development settings
2. WHEN secrets management is implemented THEN the system SHALL store MongoDB connection strings securely
3. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL protect OpenAI/Anthropic credentials from exposure
4. WHEN different environments are supported THEN the system SHALL have separate configs for dev, staging, and production
5. WHEN security is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure no secrets are committed to version control

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a full-stack developer, I want to test basic Atlas connectivity so that I can verify the mobile application can successfully connect to the MongoDB database and perform basic operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to MongoDB Atlas from the React Native app
2. WHEN basic operations are tested THEN the system SHALL perform create, read, update, and delete operations
3. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle connection failures and timeouts
4. WHEN offline scenarios are considered THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior
5. WHEN connectivity is validated THEN the system SHALL demonstrate successful data synchronization between app and database
