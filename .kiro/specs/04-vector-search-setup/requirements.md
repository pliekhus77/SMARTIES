# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the vector search setup phase (steps 4.1 - 4.5) of the SMARTIES hackathon project. The goal is to implement MongoDB Atlas Vector Search capabilities for intelligent product matching and AI-powered dietary recommendations. This phase establishes the foundation for semantic search across product ingredients and enables the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that will power the AI dietary analysis features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI engineer, I want to install sentence transformers for embeddings so that the application can convert product ingredient lists into vector representations for semantic similarity matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sentence transformers are installed THEN the system SHALL include the transformers library with pre-trained models
2. WHEN embedding models are configured THEN the system SHALL use a lightweight model suitable for ingredient text processing
3. WHEN text preprocessing is implemented THEN the system SHALL normalize ingredient lists before embedding generation
4. WHEN embedding generation is tested THEN the system SHALL successfully convert ingredient text to numerical vectors
5. WHEN performance is validated THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for 100+ products within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to generate embeddings for ingredient lists so that each product in the database has a corresponding vector representation that enables semantic search and similarity matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embedding pipeline is created THEN the system SHALL process ingredient lists from imported products
2. WHEN vector generation occurs THEN the system SHALL create consistent-dimension embeddings for all products
3. WHEN batch processing is implemented THEN the system SHALL efficiently generate embeddings for large product datasets
4. WHEN embedding storage is configured THEN the system SHALL store vectors alongside product documents in MongoDB
5. WHEN data integrity is maintained THEN the system SHALL ensure embeddings stay synchronized with product ingredient updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to configure Atlas Vector Search index so that the application can perform fast similarity searches across product embeddings for ingredient matching and product recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector index is created THEN the system SHALL configure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search on the products collection
2. WHEN index parameters are set THEN the system SHALL use appropriate similarity metrics and dimensions for ingredient embeddings
3. WHEN index optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL configure index settings for fast query performance
4. WHEN index validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify the vector index is properly built and accessible
5. WHEN query capabilities are confirmed THEN the system SHALL support k-nearest neighbor searches on product embeddings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a search engineer, I want to test similarity search functionality so that I can verify the vector search system correctly identifies similar products based on ingredient composition and dietary characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similarity queries are implemented THEN the system SHALL find products with similar ingredient profiles
2. WHEN search accuracy is validated THEN the system SHALL return relevant results for ingredient-based queries
3. WHEN performance testing occurs THEN the system SHALL execute vector searches within acceptable response times (<500ms)
4. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL handle products with minimal or unusual ingredient lists
5. WHEN search quality is measured THEN the system SHALL demonstrate meaningful similarity rankings for test queries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to create sample queries for demo so that the hackathon demonstration can showcase intelligent product matching and AI-powered recommendations based on dietary restrictions and ingredient similarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demo queries are prepared THEN the system SHALL include searches for products similar to common allergen-containing items
2. WHEN alternative product scenarios are created THEN the system SHALL demonstrate finding safe alternatives for restricted products
3. WHEN dietary restriction queries are developed THEN the system SHALL show ingredient-based filtering combined with vector similarity
4. WHEN demo data is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure sample queries return meaningful and accurate results
5. WHEN presentation scenarios are prepared THEN the system SHALL have ready-to-use examples that highlight the AI-powered recommendation capabilities
