# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a branded splash screen for the SMARTIES mobile application. The splash screen will serve as the initial loading screen that users see when launching the app, featuring the SMARTIES logo and providing a professional, branded first impression while the application initializes.

The splash screen is a critical component of the user experience, as it's the first visual element users encounter. It should reinforce the SMARTIES brand identity, provide visual feedback that the app is loading, and transition smoothly to the main application interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user launching the SMARTIES app, I want to see a professional branded splash screen with the SMARTIES logo, so that I have confidence in the app's quality and understand what application I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the SMARTIES app icon THEN the system SHALL display a splash screen with the SMARTIES logo prominently featured
2. WHEN the splash screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the brand colors defined in the design guide (Safety Green #2ECC40, Pure White #FFFFFF, Deep Black #111111)
3. WHEN the splash screen appears THEN the system SHALL center the SMARTIES logo both horizontally and vertically on the screen
4. WHEN the splash screen is shown THEN the system SHALL use the existing SMARTIES_LOGO.png asset from the design folder
5. WHEN the app is loading THEN the system SHALL display the splash screen for a minimum of 1 second and maximum of 3 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the splash screen to be accessible and provide appropriate feedback, so that I can use the app regardless of my visual or motor abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splash screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate accessibility labels for screen readers
2. WHEN using VoiceOver or TalkBack THEN the system SHALL announce "SMARTIES app loading" or equivalent
3. WHEN the splash screen is active THEN the system SHALL support high contrast mode if enabled on the device
4. WHEN the splash screen appears THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for users with visual impairments
5. WHEN the app is loading THEN the system SHALL not require any user interaction on the splash screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices and orientations, I want the splash screen to display correctly across all supported platforms and screen sizes, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches on Android THEN the system SHALL display the splash screen correctly sized for the device screen
2. WHEN the app launches on Windows THEN the system SHALL display the splash screen correctly sized for the window
3. WHEN the device is rotated THEN the system SHALL maintain proper logo positioning and sizing in both portrait and landscape orientations
4. WHEN displayed on different screen densities THEN the system SHALL use appropriate logo resolution to maintain crisp appearance
5. WHEN the splash screen loads THEN the system SHALL adapt to different aspect ratios without distorting the logo

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the app, I want the splash screen implementation to follow MAUI best practices and be easily configurable, so that future updates and modifications can be made efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the splash screen THEN the system SHALL use MAUI's built-in splash screen capabilities where available
2. WHEN the splash screen is configured THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific implementations in the Platforms folder as needed
3. WHEN the logo needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL reference the logo asset from a centralized location
4. WHEN the splash screen timing needs adjustment THEN the system SHALL use configurable values rather than hardcoded delays
5. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly from splash screen to the main scanner interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing slow app startup, I want to see loading feedback on the splash screen, so that I understand the app is working and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is taking longer than 2 seconds to load THEN the system SHALL display a subtle loading indicator
2. WHEN the loading indicator is shown THEN the system SHALL use a spinner or progress animation consistent with platform conventions
3. WHEN the app initialization completes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the main app interface
4. WHEN the splash screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL not show any error messages or technical details
5. IF the app fails to load within 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL transition to an error screen with retry options
