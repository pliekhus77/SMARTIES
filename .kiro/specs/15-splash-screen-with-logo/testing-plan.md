- GIVEN default configuration WHEN created THEN should have minimum display time of 1 second
- GIVEN default configuration WHEN created THEN should have maximum display time of 3 seconds
- GIVEN default configuration WHEN created THEN should have white background color
- GIVEN default configuration WHEN created THEN should have loading indicator enabled

## BDD Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: SMARTIES Splash Screen Display
  As a user launching the SMARTIES app
  I want to see a professional branded splash screen
  So that I have confidence in the app quality and understand what application I'm using

  Background:
    Given the SMARTIES app is installed on the device
    And the device has sufficient memory and storage
    And the SMARTIES logo assets are properly embedded

  Scenario: Normal app launch with splash screen
    Given the user is on the device home screen
    When the user taps the SMARTIES app icon
    Then the splash screen should appear immediately
    And the SMARTIES logo should be displayed prominently
    And the background should be white (#FFFFFF)
    And the splash screen should be visible for at least 1 second
    And the splash screen should transition to the main scanner interface
    And the total splash duration should not exceed 3 seconds

  Scenario: App launch with slow initialization
    Given the device has limited processing power
    And the app initialization will take more than 2 seconds
    When the user launches the SMARTIES app
    Then the splash screen should appear with the logo
    And after 2 seconds a loading indicator should appear
    And the loading indicator should be subtle and platform-appropriate
    And the splash screen should remain until app is ready
    And the transition should be smooth when initialization completes

  Scenario: App launch with accessibility enabled
    Given the user has VoiceOver enabled on iOS
    Or the user has TalkBack enabled on Android
    When the user launches the SMARTIES app
    Then the splash screen should appear normally
    And the screen reader should announce "SMARTIES app loading"
    And the splash screen should not require any user interaction
    And the transition to main interface should be announced appropriately

  Scenario: App launch in different orientations
    Given the device supports both portrait and landscape orientations
    When the user launches the app in portrait mode
    Then the splash screen should display with centered logo
    When the user rotates to landscape during splash
    Then the logo should remain centered and properly sized
    And the background should fill the entire screen
    And no distortion should occur during rotation

  Scenario: App launch with missing or corrupted logo
    Given the logo asset is missing or corrupted
    When the user launches the SMARTIES app
    Then a fallback splash screen should appear
    And the app name "SMARTIES" should be displayed as text
    And the background should still use the brand white color
    And an error should be logged for debugging
    And the app should continue to load normally

  Scenario: App launch timeout handling
    Given the app initialization encounters a critical error
    And the initialization process hangs for more than 10 seconds
    When the user launches the SMARTIES app
    Then the splash screen should appear normally
    And after 10 seconds an error screen should appear
    And the error screen should offer a retry option
    And the user should be able to retry the app launch
```

## Test Data
**Sets:** 
- Happy path: Valid logo assets, normal device performance, standard orientations
- Invalid: Missing assets, corrupted files, insufficient memory, network failures
- Edge case: Minimum/maximum timing values, extreme screen sizes, very fast/slow devices
- Performance: Various device capabilities, memory pressure scenarios, background app states

**Management:** 
- Location: `SMARTIES.MAUI.Tests/TestData/SplashScreen/`
- Generation method: Test data builders for configurations, mock assets for testing
- Cleanup strategy: Automatic cleanup after each test, isolated test environments

## Coverage Goals
**Overall:** 80% | **Critical:** 100% | **Public APIs:** 100% | **Business Logic:** 90%+

**Critical paths requiring 100% coverage:**
- Splash screen display logic
- Logo asset loading and validation
- Platform-specific implementations
- Accessibility features
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Risk Assessment
**High-Risk Areas:**
- Platform-specific splash screen implementations (extra testing on real devices needed)
- Logo asset loading failures (comprehensive fallback testing required)
- Accessibility compliance (testing with actual assistive technologies needed)
- Performance on low-end devices (testing on minimum spec devices required)
- Memory management during splash display (stress testing under memory pressure needed)

**Priorities:**
- P1 (must): Logo display, basic functionality, accessibility compliance, platform compatibility
- P2 (should): Performance optimization, smooth transitions, loading indicators, error recovery
- P3 (nice to have): Advanced animations, detailed metrics collection, extended customization options

## Security Test Scenarios
**Asset Integrity:**
- GIVEN embedded logo assets WHEN app launched THEN assets should not be tampered with
- GIVEN asset validation WHEN logo loaded THEN should verify file integrity
- GIVEN malicious asset replacement WHEN app launched THEN should detect and handle safely

**Privacy Compliance:**
- GIVEN splash screen display WHEN shown THEN should not collect any user data
- GIVEN splash screen metrics WHEN collected THEN should not include personal information
- GIVEN platform requirements WHEN splash shown THEN should comply with privacy policies

## Performance Test Scenarios
**Load Testing:**
- GIVEN multiple app launches WHEN splash displayed THEN should maintain consistent performance
- GIVEN memory pressure WHEN splash displayed THEN should complete without memory leaks
- GIVEN background processes WHEN splash displayed THEN should not significantly impact timing

**Stress Testing:**
- GIVEN rapid app launch/close cycles WHEN performed THEN splash should handle gracefully
- GIVEN low memory conditions WHEN splash displayed THEN should prioritize core functionality
- GIVEN slow storage WHEN logo loaded THEN should timeout appropriately

**Endurance Testing:**
- GIVEN extended device usage WHEN app launched THEN splash performance should remain consistent
- GIVEN thermal throttling WHEN splash displayed THEN should adapt to reduced performance
