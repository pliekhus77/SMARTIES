# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of real barcode scanning functionality for the SMARTIES MAUI mobile application using ZXing.Net.Maui. The goal is to replace the current mock barcode scanning implementation with a fully functional camera-based barcode scanner that integrates seamlessly with the existing Open Food Facts API service and dietary analysis workflow. This implementation will provide users with instant barcode recognition, proper camera permissions handling, and a smooth scanning experience across Windows and Android platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user opening the Scanner page, I want to see a camera viewfinder with clear scanning guidance so that I can easily scan product barcodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ScannerPage loads THEN the system SHALL display a ZXing camera view with barcode detection enabled
2. WHEN the camera view is active THEN the system SHALL show a semi-transparent overlay with a rectangular scanning area in the center
3. WHEN the viewfinder is displayed THEN the system SHALL include instructional text "Center barcode in the frame" below the scanning area
4. WHEN camera permissions are required THEN the system SHALL request camera access using MAUI Essentials Permissions API
5. WHEN camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL show a settings redirect dialog to enable camera access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user scanning a barcode, I want immediate feedback when a barcode is detected so that I know the scan was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ZXing detects a valid barcode THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback using MAUI Essentials HapticFeedback
2. WHEN a barcode is successfully scanned THEN the system SHALL play a success sound using MAUI audio capabilities
3. WHEN barcode detection occurs THEN the system SHALL briefly highlight the scanning area with a green border animation
4. WHEN the scan is confirmed THEN the system SHALL immediately show a loading indicator while processing the barcode
5. WHEN multiple barcodes are in view THEN the system SHALL process the first detected barcode and ignore subsequent detections for 2 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user scanning various barcode formats, I want the system to handle different barcode types correctly so that all product barcodes can be recognized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ZXing detects a barcode THEN the system SHALL accept EAN-8, EAN-13, UPC-A, UPC-E, and Code-128 formats
2. WHEN a barcode is captured THEN the system SHALL validate the barcode format and normalize it to 13-digit format
3. WHEN an invalid barcode is detected THEN the system SHALL continue scanning and show a brief "Invalid barcode format" message
4. WHEN a valid barcode is confirmed THEN the system SHALL pass the normalized barcode to the existing OpenFoodFactsService
5. WHEN barcode processing is complete THEN the system SHALL proceed with the existing product lookup and dietary analysis workflow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who encounters scanning difficulties, I want alternative options so that I can still access product information when camera scanning fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scanner is active THEN the system SHALL provide a "Manual Entry" button for damaged or unreadable barcodes
2. WHEN manual entry is selected THEN the system SHALL open a numeric input dialog with barcode format validation
3. WHEN manual barcode entry is completed THEN the system SHALL validate the format and process using the same workflow as camera scanning
4. WHEN scanning fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL show helpful tips about lighting and barcode positioning
5. WHEN the device lacks camera capability THEN the system SHALL default to manual entry mode with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the barcode scanning feature to work with screen readers so that I can use the app independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen readers are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide audio descriptions of the camera view and scanning status
2. WHEN a barcode is detected THEN the system SHALL announce "Barcode scanned successfully" via accessibility services
3. WHEN scanning guidance is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear audio instructions for barcode positioning
4. WHEN manual entry is available THEN the system SHALL ensure the input dialog is fully accessible with proper labels
5. WHEN accessibility features are active THEN the system SHALL provide voice-guided feedback for all scanning interactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user scanning products, I want the scanning experience to integrate seamlessly with the existing app workflow so that I get immediate dietary compliance results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a barcode is successfully scanned THEN the system SHALL automatically call the existing OpenFoodFactsService.GetProductAsync method
2. WHEN product data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL trigger the existing DietaryAnalysisService.AnalyzeProductAsync workflow
3. WHEN dietary analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL navigate to the ProductDetailPage with analysis results
4. WHEN the user returns from product details THEN the system SHALL return to the active camera view ready for the next scan
5. WHEN scan results are processed THEN the system SHALL save the scan to history using the existing ProductCacheService

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user scanning products on different platforms, I want consistent scanning performance across Windows and Android so that the app works reliably on all supported devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Android THEN the system SHALL use the device's rear camera with auto-focus capabilities
2. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL use the default camera device with appropriate resolution settings
3. WHEN camera initialization fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message and fallback to manual entry
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded during scanning THEN the system SHALL properly pause and resume camera operations
5. WHEN memory constraints occur THEN the system SHALL optimize camera resources and maintain app stability

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the barcode scanning feature, I want proper error handling and logging so that scanning issues can be diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL log the event and provide clear user guidance
2. WHEN ZXing initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and fallback gracefully to manual entry
3. WHEN barcode processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the exception and show user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log timing metrics for optimization analysis
5. WHEN scanning workflow completes THEN the system SHALL log success metrics for monitoring and analytics

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user concerned about battery life, I want the barcode scanner to be optimized for power efficiency so that scanning doesn't drain my device battery quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scanner is active THEN the system SHALL optimize camera settings for battery efficiency while maintaining scan quality
2. WHEN no barcode is detected for 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL show a "Tap to continue scanning" overlay to pause camera processing
3. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL immediately stop camera operations to preserve battery
4. WHEN scanning is paused THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "Resume Scanning" button to reactivate the camera
5. WHEN battery optimization is active THEN the system SHALL maintain scan accuracy while reducing CPU and camera usage

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user scanning products in various lighting conditions, I want the scanner to work effectively in different environments so that I can scan products anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN low light is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest enabling the device flashlight
2. WHEN the flashlight toggle is provided THEN the system SHALL allow users to turn the flashlight on/off during scanning
3. WHEN bright lighting causes glare THEN the system SHALL provide guidance about barcode positioning and angle
4. WHEN scanning in challenging conditions THEN the system SHALL adjust camera exposure and focus settings automatically
5. WHEN environmental scanning fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance and fallback to manual entry options
