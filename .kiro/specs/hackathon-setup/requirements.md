# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the initial setup phase (steps 0.1 - 0.5) of the SMARTIES hackathon project. The goal is to establish the foundational infrastructure and development environment needed for the 24-hour hackathon MVP demo. This phase focuses on creating the core cloud infrastructure, development environment, and basic project structure that will enable the team to build the scan-based mobile allergen tracking application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon team lead, I want to set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster so that the application can store product data, user profiles, and scan results in a scalable cloud database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the team creates a MongoDB Atlas account THEN the system SHALL provision a free tier cluster
2. WHEN the cluster is created THEN the system SHALL provide connection strings for development access
3. WHEN the database is configured THEN the system SHALL support collections for products, users, and scan results
4. WHEN network access is configured THEN the system SHALL allow connections from development environments
5. WHEN authentication is set up THEN the system SHALL use secure credentials for database access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want to set up the React Native development environment so that I can build and test the SMARTIES mobile application on both iOS and Android platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development environment is configured THEN the system SHALL support React Native CLI or Expo CLI
2. WHEN Node.js is installed THEN the system SHALL use version 18+ for compatibility
3. WHEN mobile SDKs are configured THEN the system SHALL support both iOS and Android development
4. WHEN the barcode scanner is integrated THEN the system SHALL include expo-barcode-scanner dependency
5. WHEN the environment is tested THEN the system SHALL successfully run a basic React Native app

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to initialize a GitHub repository with proper project structure so that the team can collaborate effectively and maintain code quality throughout the hackathon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is created THEN the system SHALL include a clear folder structure for mobile, backend, and infrastructure code
2. WHEN the project structure is defined THEN the system SHALL separate concerns between frontend, backend, and data layers
3. WHEN collaboration tools are set up THEN the system SHALL include README files with setup instructions
4. WHEN version control is configured THEN the system SHALL use appropriate .gitignore files for React Native and Node.js
5. WHEN the repository is initialized THEN the system SHALL include basic package.json files with required dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to create OpenAI/Anthropic API accounts so that the application can provide AI-powered dietary analysis and product recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API accounts are created THEN the system SHALL provide valid API keys for AI services
2. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL support the expected hackathon usage volume
3. WHEN API integration is tested THEN the system SHALL successfully make basic API calls
4. WHEN security is implemented THEN the system SHALL store API keys securely using environment variables
5. WHEN fallback options are considered THEN the system SHALL have backup plans if primary AI service fails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up basic CI/CD infrastructure so that the team can deploy and test the application automatically during the hackathon (optional for demo).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD is configured THEN the system SHALL support automated builds for the mobile application
2. WHEN deployment pipelines are set up THEN the system SHALL deploy backend services to cloud infrastructure
3. WHEN testing automation is implemented THEN the system SHALL run basic tests on code commits
4. WHEN monitoring is configured THEN the system SHALL provide basic health checks for deployed services
5. IF CI/CD setup becomes time-consuming THEN the team SHALL prioritize manual deployment for the hackathon demo
