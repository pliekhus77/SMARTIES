## The Monday Before HackMidwest

üíù **The Question That Changed Everything**

The Monday before HackMidwest, I asked my daughter a simple question: "If you could build any app, what would it be?" 

Without missing a beat, she replied: "I want to scan a food item and see if I can eat it."

Those twelve words hit me like a lightning bolt. Here was my 10-year-old daughter, living with multiple food allergies, articulating a problem that affects millions of families worldwide‚Äîand she'd done it with the clarity that only a child can bring to complex issues.

üè• **The Daily Reality**

For families dealing with food allergies, every meal is a calculated risk. Grocery shopping becomes a 30-minute ingredient analysis session, turning each aisle into a potential minefield. Restaurant visits require extensive questioning that makes you feel like you're conducting a food safety audit rather than enjoying a family dinner. 

My daughter has learned to read ingredient labels like a detective, scanning for hidden dairy, eggs, and tree nuts that could trigger a reaction. She's become an expert at politely declining birthday cake and Halloween candy, always carrying her EpiPen like a security blanket.

But that Monday, she wasn't just describing her challenges‚Äîshe was envisioning a solution.

‚è∞ **Perfect Timing, Perfect Storm**

HackMidwest was just days away. I'd been planning to build something impressive, something that would showcase my technical skills and maybe catch the attention of sponsors. But suddenly, those plans felt hollow compared to the genuine need my daughter had just articulated.

This wasn't going to be another hackathon project built for judges and demo day. This was going to be SMARTIES (Scan-based Mobile Allergen Risk Tracking & IntelligencE Suite)‚Äîan app built for the most important user I'd ever have: my daughter.

The stakes had just become deeply personal, professionally challenging, and technically ambitious all at once. I had 24 hours to build something that could genuinely change how families like ours navigate food safety.

Sometimes the best product requirements come from the people we love most.
