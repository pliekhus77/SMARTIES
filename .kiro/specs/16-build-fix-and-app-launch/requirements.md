# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SMARTIES MAUI application currently has multiple build errors preventing it from running. According to the MOBILE_APP_STATUS.md document, the app was previously working and buildable, but recent changes have introduced compilation errors. This feature aims to fix all build issues and restore the app to a runnable state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SMARTIES MAUI application to build successfully without errors, so that I can run and test the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `dotnet build SMARTIES.MAUI` THEN the build SHALL complete successfully with zero errors
2. WHEN I run `dotnet run --project SMARTIES.MAUI -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0` THEN the application SHALL launch successfully
3. IF there are compilation warnings THEN they SHALL be documented but not block the build
4. WHEN the build completes THEN all service dependencies SHALL be properly resolved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all interface implementations to match their contracts, so that dependency injection works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are registered in MauiProgram.cs THEN all interface implementations SHALL exist and match their contracts
2. WHEN IDietaryAnalysisService is used THEN it SHALL have the correct method signatures matching the interface
3. WHEN UserProfile is accessed THEN it SHALL have all required methods like GetAllRestrictions()
4. IF there are duplicate service definitions THEN they SHALL be resolved to use a single implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all enum values to be consistent across the codebase, so that there are no compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ComplianceLevel enum is used THEN it SHALL use the values defined in DietaryAnalysis.cs (Safe, Caution, Violation)
2. WHEN code references ComplianceLevel.Warning or ComplianceLevel.Critical THEN it SHALL be updated to use the correct enum values
3. WHEN code references ComplianceLevel.Compliant THEN it SHALL be updated to use ComplianceLevel.Safe
4. IF there are duplicate enum definitions THEN they SHALL be removed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all model properties to exist and be accessible, so that services can use them without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Product model is accessed THEN properties like CategoriesJson and NutritionFactsJson SHALL exist or be replaced with working alternatives
2. WHEN BarcodeDetectedEventArgs is used THEN it SHALL have the correct property names for accessing barcode data
3. WHEN UserProfile is used THEN it SHALL have the GetAllRestrictions() method implemented
4. IF properties don't exist THEN they SHALL be added or the code SHALL be updated to use existing properties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to launch with a functional UI, so that I can verify the app works end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN it SHALL display the main interface without crashing
2. WHEN the app starts THEN all XAML pages SHALL load without binding errors
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN all ViewModels SHALL be properly instantiated
4. IF there are missing services THEN they SHALL be implemented with basic functionality or mocked

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate and conflicting service definitions resolved, so that dependency injection works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IBatteryOptimizationService is registered THEN there SHALL be only one implementation used
2. WHEN services have namespace conflicts THEN they SHALL be resolved using fully qualified names
3. WHEN ProductService is referenced THEN it SHALL exist or be replaced with an existing service
4. IF there are ambiguous references THEN they SHALL be resolved by choosing the appropriate implementation
