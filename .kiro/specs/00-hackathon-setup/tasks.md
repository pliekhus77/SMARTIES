## Notes

- Tasks marked with "*" are optional and should only be implemented if time permits during the hackathon setup phase
- Priority should be given to core functionality (tasks 1-5) before moving to testing and CI/CD setup
- All API keys and sensitive configuration should be stored securely and never committed to version control
- The setup should prioritize speed and functionality over production-grade configuration for the hackathon environment
