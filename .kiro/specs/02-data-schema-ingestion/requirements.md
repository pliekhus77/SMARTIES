# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the data schema and ingestion phase (steps 2.1 - 2.5) of the SMARTIES hackathon project. The goal is to establish a robust product data foundation with proper schema design and initial sample data that will enable immediate testing and development of the dietary compliance features. This phase focuses on creating the data structure and populating it with sufficient product information to demonstrate core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to define a comprehensive product schema with allergen fields so that the application can store detailed product information including ingredients, allergens, and dietary compliance data in a structured format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the product schema is defined THEN the system SHALL include fields for UPC, product name, brand, ingredients list, and allergen information
2. WHEN allergen fields are structured THEN the system SHALL support the FDA Top 9 allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, sesame)
3. WHEN dietary compliance fields are added THEN the system SHALL include boolean flags for halal, kosher, vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free status
4. WHEN nutritional data is considered THEN the system SHALL include optional fields for calories, sodium, sugar, and other key nutrients
5. WHEN the schema is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data types, required fields, and validation rules are enforced

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to create a sample dataset with 50-100 products manually so that the development team has immediate access to realistic test data covering various allergen scenarios and dietary restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sample dataset is created THEN the system SHALL include 50-100 diverse food products with complete ingredient information
2. WHEN allergen coverage is ensured THEN the system SHALL include products containing each of the major allergens for testing purposes
3. WHEN dietary variety is provided THEN the system SHALL include products suitable for different dietary restrictions (vegan, kosher, halal, gluten-free)
4. WHEN product categories are represented THEN the system SHALL include items from major food categories (dairy, snacks, beverages, prepared foods)
5. WHEN data quality is maintained THEN the system SHALL ensure all sample products have accurate UPC codes and ingredient lists

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to include common allergens in the test data so that the allergen detection functionality can be thoroughly tested with realistic scenarios during development and demo preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN allergen test cases are created THEN the system SHALL include products with single allergen exposure (e.g., pure milk products)
2. WHEN complex allergen scenarios are covered THEN the system SHALL include products with multiple allergens (e.g., cookies with milk, eggs, and wheat)
3. WHEN hidden allergen cases are included THEN the system SHALL have products where allergens appear in unexpected forms (e.g., milk derivatives, wheat-based additives)
4. WHEN allergen-free options are provided THEN the system SHALL include products that are safe for common allergies to test negative cases
5. WHEN edge cases are considered THEN the system SHALL include products with "may contain" warnings and cross-contamination risks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to add religious and dietary flags to products so that users with specific religious or lifestyle dietary requirements can quickly identify compliant products during scanning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN halal certification is tracked THEN the system SHALL include products with verified halal status and ingredients
2. WHEN kosher compliance is managed THEN the system SHALL include products with kosher certification levels (dairy, meat, pareve)
3. WHEN vegan products are identified THEN the system SHALL flag products containing no animal-derived ingredients
4. WHEN vegetarian options are marked THEN the system SHALL distinguish between products suitable for vegetarians (no meat/fish)
5. WHEN gluten-free status is maintained THEN the system SHALL identify products safe for celiac disease and gluten sensitivity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test data insertion and basic queries so that I can verify the database schema works correctly and supports the query patterns needed for the mobile application's core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data insertion is tested THEN the system SHALL successfully insert all sample products into MongoDB Atlas without errors
2. WHEN UPC lookup queries are validated THEN the system SHALL retrieve products by barcode in under 100ms for indexed queries
3. WHEN allergen filtering is tested THEN the system SHALL support queries to find products containing or excluding specific allergens
4. WHEN dietary restriction queries work THEN the system SHALL filter products by religious and lifestyle dietary flags
5. WHEN data integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL ensure all inserted data maintains proper relationships and validation rules
