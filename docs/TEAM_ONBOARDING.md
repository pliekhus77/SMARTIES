# SMARTIES Team Onboarding Guide

## üëã Welcome to the SMARTIES Hackathon Team!

This guide will get you up and running quickly so you can contribute effectively during our hackathon.

## üéØ Project Overview

**SMARTIES** (Scan‚Äëbased Mobile Allergen Risk Tracking & IntelligencE Suite) is a React Native app that helps users make safe dietary choices by scanning product barcodes and receiving real-time compliance alerts.

### Key Features
- **Instant Barcode Scanning**: Sub-3-second scan-to-result response
- **Dietary Analysis**: Allergies, religious restrictions, medical conditions, lifestyle preferences
- **Safety-First Alerts**: Red (danger), Yellow (caution), Green (safe)
- **AI-Powered**: MongoDB Atlas + OpenAI/Anthropic for intelligent analysis

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
