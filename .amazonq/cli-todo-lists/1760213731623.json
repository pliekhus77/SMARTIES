Set up proper test environment with ts-jest preset.\n\n2. **Test Setup and Mocking**: Created comprehensive test setup file with global mocks for fetch, console methods, and proper test isolation between test runs.\n\n3. **Test Data Builders**: Built robust test data builders using the Builder pattern for Products, UserProfiles, and ScanResults. Includes common test scenarios like milk allergic users, nut products, safe products, etc.\n\n4. **Mock Services**: Created complete mock services for Atlas (database), AI service, barcode scanner, and HTTP client. All mocks include test helpers for easy configuration in tests.\n\n5. **Core Service Tests**: Implemented comprehensive unit tests for:\n   - DietaryService: Allergen detection, compliance checking, vegan restrictions\n   - BarcodeService: Scanning, validation, retry logic, permission handling\n   - Component Logic: ProductCard and DietaryAlert business logic\n\n6. **Test Coverage**: 60 tests passing across 6 test suites covering:\n   - Configuration management (3 tests)\n   - Security implementations (17 tests) \n   - Service logic (20 tests)\n   - Component logic (20 tests)\n\nKey testing features implemented:\n- Builder pattern for consistent test data\n- Comprehensive mocking strategy\n- Async testing with proper error handling\n- Edge case coverage (empty data, failures, retries)\n- Business logic validation\n- Type-safe test implementations\n\nAll tests passing - testing framework is production-ready for the hackathon team to build upon.","Completed Jest and React Native Testing Library configuration. Set up comprehensive testing framework with TypeScript support, proper test environment, and all necessary testing utilities."],"modified_files":["package.json","src/test/setup.ts","src/test/builders/testDataBuilders.ts","src/test/mocks/mockServices.ts","src/services/__tests__/dietaryService.test.ts","src/services/__tests__/barcodeService.test.ts","src/components/__tests__/ProductCard.test.tsx","src/components/__tests__/DietaryAlert.test.tsx","package.json","src/test/setup.ts","src/test/builders/testDataBuilders.ts","src/test/mocks/mockServices.ts","src/services/__tests__/dietaryService.test.ts","src/services/__tests__/barcodeService.test.ts","src/components/__tests__/ProductCard.test.tsx","src/components/__tests__/DietaryAlert.test.tsx"],"id":"1760213731623"}
