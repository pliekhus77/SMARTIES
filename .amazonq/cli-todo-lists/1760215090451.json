Built CrossPlatformTestRunner for running tests across multiple platforms.\n\n2. **iOS Platform Tests**: Implemented complete iOS-specific functionality tests covering:\n   - Platform detection and screen dimensions\n   - Feature availability (camera, barcode scanner, notifications, biometric auth)\n   - Barcode scanning with iOS-specific behavior and supported formats\n   - Storage operations using iOS paths and keychain simulation\n   - Notification system with iOS-specific scheduling\n   - Performance characteristics and error handling\n\n3. **Android Platform Tests**: Implemented complete Android-specific functionality tests covering:\n   - Platform detection with different device specs (Pixel 8, Android 14)\n   - Feature availability including Android-specific capabilities\n   - Barcode scanning with extended format support (Data Matrix, Code 39)\n   - Storage operations using Android SharedPreferences simulation\n   - Notification system with Android-specific channels\n   - Android-specific features (back button, app state changes)\n   - Performance characteristics and error handling\n\n4. **Cross-Platform Comparison Tests**: Built comprehensive comparison tests that:\n   - Validate platform detection differences\n   - Compare screen dimensions and performance profiles\n   - Test barcode scanning across platforms with performance differences\n   - Validate storage operations with platform-specific paths and timing\n   - Ensure consistent feature availability for core features\n   - Test complete scanning workflow on both platforms\n   - Handle error scenarios consistently across platforms\n\n5. **Test Results**: All 59 platform tests passing, demonstrating:\n   - Proper platform detection and environment setup\n   - Feature availability validation for both iOS and Android\n   - Barcode scanning functionality with platform-specific behaviors\n   - Storage operations with correct platform paths\n   - Performance differences between platforms\n   - Consistent error handling across platforms\n   - Complete workflow validation from permissions to data storage\n\nKey cross-platform features validated:\n- Platform-specific UI dimensions and performance profiles\n- Barcode scanner availability and format support differences\n- Storage path differences (iOS Documents vs Android SharedPreferences)\n- Permission handling consistency\n- Notification system differences (iOS vs Android channels)\n- Performance characteristics (iOS faster storage, Android more formats)\n- Error handling consistency across platforms\n\nCross-platform testing framework provides confidence that SMARTIES will work correctly on both iOS and Android devices.","Completed cross-platform test utilities creation. Built comprehensive PlatformTestUtils class and CrossPlatformTestRunner for testing across iOS, Android, and web platforms with proper environment setup and cleanup."],"modified_files":["src/test/platform/platformUtils.ts","src/test/platform/ios.platform.test.ts","src/test/platform/android.platform.test.ts","src/test/platform/crossPlatform.test.ts","package.json","src/test/platform/platformUtils.ts","src/test/platform/ios.platform.test.ts","src/test/platform/android.platform.test.ts","src/test/platform/crossPlatform.test.ts","package.json"],"id":"1760215090451"}
