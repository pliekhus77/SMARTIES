# SMARTIES Architecture Update Summary

## Current Architecture (Post-Backend Cleanup)

SMARTIES has been simplified to a React Native mobile application with direct API integrations:

### Core Components
- **React Native Mobile App**: Primary user interface with barcode scanning
- **AsyncStorage**: Local data persistence for offline functionality
- **Direct API Integration**: Open Food Facts and AI services
- **AI Services**: OpenAI/Anthropic for dietary analysis

### Removed Components
- Express.js backend server
- MongoDB Atlas database
- Backend API layer
- Database connection utilities

### Benefits of Simplified Architecture
- Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead
- Faster development cycles
- Direct API integration for real-time data
- Improved performance with fewer network hops

### Data Flow
```
Mobile App → Open Food Facts API
     ↓              ↓
AsyncStorage ← AI Services (OpenAI/Anthropic)
```

### Security
- Environment variables for API keys
- Local encrypted storage for user profiles
- HTTPS for all external API communications
